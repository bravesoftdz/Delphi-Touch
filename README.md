Delphi components for Touchscreen interfaces

I created these components for a private project where i made a ELM327 OBD2 application for Car Diagnostics, for use on a Touchscreen Windows Tablet (Thomson â‚¬100). I couldnt find components to my liking, and i didnt want scrollbars - and big buttons, so i made these components. They consist of various components like a Toolbar, navigation bar, button panel, simple list and header lists. 

I am keeping this application for myself, so it will not be released (maybe in the future).

Some images to show you how it looks; I used the Delphi VCL themes, but it works without the themes - default Windows look and feel too.

There is also a camera component, i used this to be able to take photo's with my tablet, you can choose the camera (DirectX) and still the image for saving. The components might need some work, you can change these to your own liking.
I might update these components and create a nice package out of it in the future, but if you like to help me with it please let me know :)
